# Snaze project for Linguagem de Programação I (LP I)

 A simulation of the classic Snake arcade video game with a twist: the snake is trapped inside a maze!
 
 ## Goal
 
This program tries to find a correct path from a snake to an apple.To find the solution we are based on the backtracking method in order to find the correct coordinates.

## Requirements

You must have doxygen installed on your computer.This will automatically generate documentation for code, but if you don't have on your computer just do this:

`$ sudo apt-get install doxygen`
 
## Failures
this code still has errors, the findapple function ignores as walls
